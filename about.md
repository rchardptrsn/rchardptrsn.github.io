<br>
Technical Analyst for an document, reporting, and accounting software company serving the real estate title industry. SQL and application performance is my career and passion and I enjoy solving complex problems with databases, Dev Ops, and infrastructure.

I graduated from Northwestern University in 2023 with a Master's in Public Policy and Administration. I studied program evaluation, statistics and data science, economics, public policy theory, and administration. I wrote my Master's Capstone paper on [climate change and adaption for cities in the United States](/climate-change-for-cities-mitigation-and-adaptation).
