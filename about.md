<br>
Technical Analyst for a Real Estate Title Insurance document generation and accounting software company. SQL and application performance is my career and passion and I enjoy getting in the weeds with architecture and infrastructure problems.

I graduated from Northwestern University in 2023 with a Master's in Public Policy and Administration. I studied program evaluation, statistics and data science, economics, public policy theory, and administration. I wrote my Master's thesis on climate change and adaption for cities in the United States. 

I am an avid outdoorsman currently living in Taos, NM. I have 3 dogs that run my life.
